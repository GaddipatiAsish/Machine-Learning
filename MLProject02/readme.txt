Description:
	This project concentrates on implementation and experimental analysis of Support Vector Machines and 4 types of perceptron algorithms.
		
		Four Implementations of Perceptron Algorithms:
		a) Perceptron 
		b) Averaged Perceptrom
		c) Kernel Perceptron
		d) Averaged Kernel Perceptron

Testing is done through the Test class that is there test package of the project.
Detailed inline comments are written of the Test class to on How to run.

For SVM script related documentation go through the readme.txt file that is present in the SVMLight folder of the Project. The naming conventions that i have followed are self explanatory like All the Models file will be created in the svmModels folders.
